## Feedback

- toy model
  - graph problem, 0-generosity have utility does not make sense
  
- relationship between health perception and actual spending (mc)
  - show that health perception is better than actual spending, could use the 
  sigma of both to compare
- the parameter set $vertheta$ should be more clear
- the MLE estimation formula should not include the weights in the weighted log likelihood
- the risk aversion could get involved in the preference of generosity, the interpretation of it could be mixed
- explain why people get more utility from the HMO than PPO, and the cost
- what is your contribution to the literature, other than just apply the BLP to MA market
- explain the negative of firm fixed effect: more bargaining power/more efficient
- the generosity measure: expected OOP, conditonal on one health condition, make it more clear
- speak faster
- do not spending too much time on the detail of toy model.
- FAQ: why gov allow the plan design which could lead to the selection problem.

## Thoughts

- introduction and motivation
  - managed competation in healthcare insurance: firm offer plans, consumer choose plan, gov subsidize firm by pay capitation
  - without risk adjustment: 'cream-skimming', firm select the healthy
  - to solve this, gov introduce risk adjustment, so that high-risk is compensated
  - however, risk adjustment cannot fully solve this
  - simplied case: healthy, unhealty, 65-year-old, 85-year-old
  - the risk adjustment on the group level (65/85) will overestimate the spending of healthy and underestimate the spending of unhealthy
  - this paper:
    - research question:
    - 
- date: individual level, plan level, county level
- model: time, demand, supply
- result: demand, supply, counterfactual
