## Feedback

- toy model
  - graph problem, 0-generosity have utility does not make sense
  
- relationship between health perception and actual spending (mc)
  - show that health perception is better than actual spending, could use the 
  sigma of both to compare
- the parameter set $vertheta$ should be more clear
- the MLE estimation formula should not include the weights in the weighted log likelihood
- the risk aversion could get involved in the preference of generosity, the interpretation of it could be mixed
- explain why people get more utility from the HMO than PPO, and the cost
- what is your contribution to the literature, other than just apply the BLP to MA market
- explain the negative of firm fixed effect: more bargaining power/more efficient
- the generosity measure: expected OOP, conditonal on one health condition, make it more clear
- speak faster
- do not spending too much time on the detail of toy model.
- FAQ: why gov allow the plan design which could lead to the selection problem.
