        Medicare is a U.S. federal health insurance program mainly for individuals aged 65 and older, comprising two main components:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Traditional Medicare (TM)}: A fee-for-service (FFS) system, typically paired with Medigap plans.
          \item \textbf{Medicare Advantage (MA)}: A managed competition framework where private insurers, subsidized by the government, often offer plans with \textbf{lower premiums and reduced generosity} compared to Traditional Medicare (TM).
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Managed Competition}: The government provides fixed and predetermined subsidies to private insurance firms, which in turn offer insurance plans to beneficiaries.
          \item \textbf{Cream Skimming}: Firms strategically target healthier beneficiaries to maximize profits.
          \item \textbf{Risk Adjustment}: The government adjusts subsidy payments to insurers based on beneficiaries' observable characteristics.
        \end{itemize}
      \end{block}

      % Motivation
      \begin{block}{Motivation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Self-Selection}: Beneficiaries make enrollment decisions based on their private information.
            \item Due to private infromation, beneficiaries sharing the same risk-adjusted subsidy payment may have different unobserved health perceptions. For example, healthier beneficiaries prefer to enroll in plans with lower premiums and reduced generosity, while less healthy beneficiaries opt for plans with higher premiums and greater generosity.
            \item The current risk adjustment mechanism implicitly assumes that beneficiaries with identical observable characteristics possess the same unobserved health perceptions, which may not be accurate in practice.
            \item Consequently, it fails to account for self-selection effects, leading to ``cream-skimming'' incentives for MA firms to target healthier beneficiaries by strategically designing plans with lower premiums and reduced generosity.
            \item Although much of the literature has focused on competition and selection within Medicare Advantage, attention to self-selection under the current risk adjustment mechanism remains limited.
        \end{itemize}

      % Goals
      \begin{block}{Goals}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Theoretical}: Developed a managed competition model incorporating endogenous plan design and self-selection under private information.
          \item \textbf{Empirical}: Applied the model to Medicare Advantage data, evaluating the welfare implications of self-selection effects.
          \item \textbf{Policy}: Provided insights for enhancing risk adjustment payment policies to mitigate market distortions.
        \end{itemize}

      % Method
      \begin{block}{Method}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Develop a structural model of demand and supply that incorporates self-selection and endogenous plan design.
          \item Estimate the model using Medicare Advantage data.
          \item Conduct counterfactual simulation to analyze scenario where self-selection effects are neutralized.
        \end{itemize}
      \end{block}

      % Presentation
      \begin{block}{Model \& Estimation}
      \begin{center}
      \textbf{Demand}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The model incorporates self-selection effects, where beneficiaries with different unobserved health perceptions, which leads to heterogeneous preferences for plan design.
        \item The health perceptions are assumed to follow a distribution with a mean of the predicted health status by the risk adjustment model with a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\tau}$.
      \end{itemize}
      \end{center}
      \input{figures/tables/demand_result_1.tex}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The private health perception significantly affect the plan choice of beneficiaries.
        \item For beneficiaries sharing the same risk adjusted subsidy payment, the private health perception could be very different, which leads to different plan choices. This aligns well with the self-selection effects.
      \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{center}
      \textbf{Supply}
    \end{center}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The model incorporates endogenous plan design, where firms strategically design plans to maximize profits.
      \item The cost structure of plans allows the self-selection effects.
    \end{itemize}
    
      \input{figures/tables/cost_result.tex}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The generosity of the plan is the most important factor in determining the cost of the plan.
        \item The marginal cost increase non-linearly with the generosity of the plan, suggesting that the self-selection effects.
        \item Because of the self-selection effects, a high generosity will attract beneficiaries with bad health

        \begin{center}
          \textbf{Equal-Profit Risk Adjustment}
        \end{center}

        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Goal}: Align subsidies so firms earn the same profit from healthy and sick enrollees, removing cream-skimming incentives.
          \item \textbf{Approach}: Adjust plan subsidy payments so expected profits are uniform across all beneficiaries.
          \item \textbf{Impact}: Firms no longer have incentives to favor healthier individuals.

        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Firm Response}: Firms optimize their plan designs to maximize profits under the new risk adjustment mechanism. Consequently, the updated plan designs are generally more generous and feature higher premiums.
          \item \textbf{Consumer Surplus}: Total consumer surplus increases by 11.01\% with the new risk adjustment-based plan designs.
          \item \textbf{Producer Surplus}: Medicare Advantage plans become more attractive, resulting in a 34.60\% increase in total producer surplus under the new risk adjustment mechanism.

      % Takeaways
      \begin{block}{Takeaways}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Conventional risk adjustment mechanisms do not fully eliminate cream-skimming incentives, leading to market distortions and welfare losses.
          \item The proposed equal-profit risk adjustment mechanism can further mitigate cream-skimming incentives by accounting for self-selection effects, leading to improved market outcomes and welfare gains.
